            <h2>About Piso Firme</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Piso Firme was a large-scale Mexican Program that aimed to replace
              dirt floors with cement ones. In particular, a household could ask
              for up to 50 square meters of cement to replace part of their
              house's floors. Between 2000 and 2005 Piso Firme has been offered
              to the population of Torreón, a mexican city in the state of
              Coahuila, but not to Gómez Palacios and Lerdo, two twin cities
              near to Torreón but in the state of Durango. You would ask what is
              the purpose of this story: well, the treatment city (Torreón)
              shares with the two control cities almost every socioeconomic
              indicator, which means that the towns can be effectively
              considered one single urban area. Consequently, households
              residing near the border in these cities were likely to be similar
              except for the influence of state policies.

              <p>
                The argentinian Matias D. Cattaneo, together with other
                researchers, used this specificity to assess the impact of this
                well known mexican program on children's health and adult
                happiness. In particular, the authors asked themselves three
                questions:

            <p class="text-justify">
              To answer these questions, the authors started their research in
              the year 2005, basing it first of all on the census data from the
              year 2000. They used many socioeconomic indicators at individual
              and household level, present in the dataset, to create the
              treatment and the control group with a proper matching. Once the
              groups had been created, the researchers conducted a survey with
              questions related to the number of rooms with cement floor per
              household and to mothers' mental health. <br />
              They then collected medical data from children in the two groups,
              with respect to parasite count in their body and the presence of
              diseases like chronical diarrhea and anemia. They also evaluated
              children's scores on popular cognitive-development tests like
              MacArthur Communicative Development Test and Picture Peabody
              Vocabulary Test.

            <h2>Some Data</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Here we present some preliminary data of the study. As we said,
              the two groups (treatment and control) were obtained matching the
              distributions of many socioeconomic indicators taken from the
              census dataset. The matching, done at census blocks level, took
              into account variables like
              <i
                >proportion of households with dirt floors, average number of
                children between 0 and 5 yrs of age, average number of rooms per
                household...

                >second table of the paper</a
              >. <br />So, after the researchers found comparable blocks, they
              conducted the aforementioned survey across the households in those
              blocks. It must also be reported that the authors verified that
              the two groups shared similar secular trends for each indicator
              used in the matching, proving that the similarity done according
              to the 2000 census' data still held when looking at the same
              variables from 1994 to 1999. <br />

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
              We present the results of this research study in three sections,
              according to the three questions the authors tried to answer.
              <br />
              To assess the effect of Piso Firme on each variable, the authors
              ran three different regression models for each outcome, each one
              with more control variables than the previous one, on the entire
              dataset (treatment + control). We report the results of the third
              model (the most complete one). The program's contribution is
              measured taking into account the coefficient of the dummy variable
              related to the participation to Piso Firme, together with its
              clustered standard error at census-block level. in order to
              measure Piso Firme's impact on the treatment group with respect to
              the control one in percentage, the authors then computed
              <i>100 × coefficient/control mean</i> for every outcome. Of
              course, the higher (in absolute value) the coefficient, the higher
              the impact. We report only this last value, for each outcome
              variable, reminding you that for all the results and a more in
              depth explanation, for example on the control variables used in
              the regression models, you can refer to the paper. <br />

            Regressions of Cement Floor Coverage Measures on Program Dummy

            This first table shows the impact of Piso Firme in terms of its
            primary objective: the coverage of cement floors in the household.
            As said, for each outcome variable the program's effect is computed
            in percentage with respect to the control group mean of the same
            variable. As you can notice, for each outcome variable the program
            has been a success.

            robustness we run different and more complex models with respect to
            a simple linear regression, using a tecnique called

            part, but nothing too worrying. We will walk you thorugh an example
            with a linear regression model on table 4 as it is the simplest

            This plot tells us how much change is caused by a feature when we

            could have very different scales, therefore comparing their
            magnitudes is akin to comparing apples with oranges! Hence, to
            properly evaluate the impact of a feature, we consider:

            In particular, for a Linear Regression, the SHAP values of a
            prediction are singular for each feature. Each SHAP value represents
            the contribution of the related feature to the difference between
            the expected value of the model and its prediction for that single
            datapoint, i.e:

            highest, indicating that it has the most important impact on the
            prediction of that point. Nevertheless, we can see that there are
            other variables that contributed significantly to the predicition,

                    <b>Well... We do!</b>
                    <br />
                    The rooms that are correlated with the outcome are all
                    common spaces (kitchen, dining room, bathtroom), while the
                    bedroom, which is not a common space, is not correlated, in
                    terms of "cementification" of the floor, with
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_rooms</span>. This
                    could be explained: since the amount of cement each
                    household could receive was enought to cover up to
                    <span class="font-italic">50 square meters of floor</span>,
                    if a household had many rooms they would have had, probably,
                    more than one bedroom. So, how would they decide which room
                    to put cement in? Of course the fairest choice is to put
                    cement in a common space, and not in one of the bedrooms. So
                    the more rooms a household had, the more likely was to use
                    Piso Firme to put cement in a common room and not in one
                    bedroom... <b>Interesting</b>.

                    it is possible to make some more considerations: we notice

                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_dem2</span> and

                    the number of males and females between 6 and 17 years in
                    the family, in 2005, have a positive correlation with the
                    outcome, while
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_HHpeople</span>
                    (number of household members) correlation with
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace"
                      >S_cementfloorbed</span
                    >
                    is hugely negative. <b>What is going on?</b><br />
                    Let's start with
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_HHpeople</span>:
                    normally, the more households members, the more bedrooms
                    there are in a house. As we said in the first point of this
                    analysis, when a house has more than one bedroom, it's more
                    likely the family decided to put cement in a common space,
                    in a "democratic" fashion. <b>But</b> why, then, the
                    correlation with the children-related variables? Let's not
                    forget that, while the survey was conducted in 2005, Piso
                    Firme started to take place (for the treatment group) in
                    2000. This means that, in 2000,
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_dem2</span> and
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_dem6</span>
                    represented the number of children between 1 and 12 years
                    old in the house. From a parent perspective, it makes total
                    sense to put cement in the bedroom (or in children's
                    bedroom, if there's more than one bedroom)! So if, when Piso
                    Firme was offered to the household, children were present,
                    their parents would decide to put cement in their bedroom to
                    ensure them better life conditions.

            This is only the first analysis of this extension, but we understood
            many things: first of all Mexican people, at least from this
            perspective, think in a "democratic" way: if only one part of the
            family could live better having cement floor in its bedroom, well,
            that's not fair and so cement was put in a common space of the
            house. Secondly, this "democratic" way of thinking doesn't apply to
            the situation in which there are children in the family, that are
            privileged in the choice of where to put cement. It would be nice to
            interview again the households that took part in the 2005 survey to
            assess whether our conclusion are well thought, but unfortunately
            this is not possible. However, it's still wonderful to see how many
            considerations can be made with a "simple" dataset like the one we
            are analysing.

            <p class="text-justify mt-5">
              We now turn our attention to decision tree models. To estimate the
              impact of each feature, we consider when the split occurs: the
              tree will try to split at first on the features with the highest
              predictive value. We also take into account the SHAP values of
              each model.
              <br />
              Again, for the sake of brevity, we don't show each tree in its
              complete form, we only report the first three levels, and the SHAP
              values of the models. You can visualize each model in a more
              complete fashion in our notebook. In particular, in the
              aforementioned notebook we also report the feature importance plot
              for each decision tree, which is not significant for our analysis
              since it is biased by the presence of many unique values in the
              data.

                    which is the most important feature according to the SHAP
                    plot. This confirms the authors' claims and, in general, the
                    importance of the program. We also notice that the variables
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_rooms</span> and
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_waterhouse</span>
                    play a significant role in the decision, exactly as we
                    stated before with the regression. This brings us to the
                    same conclusions that we made for the previous step.

                    implying that it has a higher predictive power, at least for
                    this model, than the program-related variable
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">dpisofirme</span>.
                    This is comparable to what we observed with the linear
                    regression: it is true that in the previous model the SHAP
                    value of
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">dpisofirme</span>
                    was slightly higher than the one of

                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_waterhouse</span>
                    but the difference was not significant. This means that our
                    observations for this particular outcome can still be
                    considered valid.

                    the situation is pretty different from the one observed
                    before: it is true that the first split occurs on the
                    program dummy variable, but we don't observe anymore the
                    variables related to the number of children (in particular
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_dem6</span>). This
                    shows that our assumption made about this outcome is not
                    really supported by the data. It could still be true in some
                    parts though, at least with respect to
                    <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_HHpeople</span>.
                    This means, as we said, that the more people lived in the
                    house, the higher was the chance to choose to put cement in
                    a common room and not in a bedroom.

            In conclusion, we achieved more or less the same results as before.
            Our previous analysis on Mexican people can still be considered
            valid, at least with respect to the decision related to the room in
            which the cement was put. We can state again that this analysis is
            more in depth and complete than the one provided by the authors, as
            it sheds light on several correlations that are not necessarly
            reported in the paper. We cannot deny the impact of Piso Firme on
            the considered outcomes, but it should be put against the
            contribution of other factors, described by the other features, that
            we tried to underline.

          <p class="text-justify mt-3">
            <b>Note</b>: We also repeated the same analysis on a Random Forest
            model. We do not
            report the results here, as they are comparable to the ones
            presented here. Moreover, in our extension notebook we use another
            approach of assessment to evaluate the consistency of our results,
            which is called LIME. The problem with LIME is that, ulinke SHAP, it
            only provides explanations for single predictions, and thus is not
            suitable for our purposes. Again, we don't report our considerations
            about LIME in this page because they aren't really useful for our
            questions and conclusions, but if you are interested in a more
            techincal and in depth analysis, please refer to the notebook.

            Random Forest model on our notebook, which confirmed our tests.

            Other than the impact of
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">dpisofirme</span>, which is
            not as significant as before, we notice, as expected, that the age
            of the child taken into account plays a significant role, especially
            for the variables directly related to diseases, namely
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_parcount</span>,
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_diarrhea</span> and
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_anemia</span>. In
            particular, it seems that, for the parasite count, this is
            positively correlated with the age of the person. This means that
            the older the child was in 2005, the higher was the count of
            parasites in its body (on average). For the other two variables we
            notice a significant <b>negative</b> correlation with the age. This
            can be considered normal, since some diseases are more related to
            young children, others to older ones. An important consideration
            must be made with respect to
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_waterhouse</span> and
            <span class="bg-light text-monospace">S_washhands</span>: while for
            anemia and parasite count they don't seem to be so important, for
            diarrhea it is pretty clear that having water in the house higly
            reduces the risk of this disease. This might be only a coincidence
            (we repeat it: correlation doesn't mean causation), but it surely
            might be a starting point for future studies. <br />
            Maybe, then, a program similar to Piso Firme could be offered to
            ensure every mexican has water (and, consequently, a better hygene)
            in their house. Also, having animals inside seems to be positively
            correlated with the same disease. We don't notice other significant
            correlations in the other variables: often the one with the highest
            SHAP value is a
            <i>missing</i> one, which is just a dummy variable used to deal with
            null values, as explained in our respective replications.

                    the survey, as well as between the participation to the

                    With respect to table 5, showed that what the authors
                    claimed in the paper is true (although the effect of Piso
                    Firme doesn't seem to be as important as for the previous
                    table, but this was expected, given the nature of the
                    outcomes). Then we tried to assess the impact of

                    children-related health variables. We noticed a significant
                    negative correlation with the diarrhea "disease". Having no
                    access to water in the house (and thus a proper bathroom as

                    had to make a choice about how to spend its money in terms
                    of social programs. We saw how successful Piso Firme has
                    been, what would happen with a program of this kind, with
                    the aim of bringing water to every house?

            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="text-justify">
            To conclude: the authors of "House, Health and Happiness" are
            definetly right about the impact of Piso Firme on the general well
            being of mexican people, but for us it has been more interesting to
            see how many hypotheses, claims and theories can be formulated
            analysing datasets like the provided ones. We hope you found this
            journey as fascinating as we did.
